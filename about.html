    <h2 style="text-align: center">
        My entire life,
        I've wanted to 
        be a professional 
        musician.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <p class="centered" style="font-size: x-large">
        When I was eight years old, a friend
        from church came over to hang out. We
        were listening to music and talking.
        At some point, a certain song came on
        which sparked an ambitious conversation. 
        I expressed to my friend, in so many words,
        that although I liked the song, I would
        have done things differently. He asked how & 
        I elaborated.
        <br>
        <br>
        "You know, you can make your own songs 
        if you want to...why not?..." he said to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        With a passion that has lingered in me ever
        since, I grabbed a paper and
        pencil, locked myself in a room and started
        writing. I wrote a song with only lyrics.
        I kept writing songs, singing them acapella
        at church youth service, which became a sort
        of routine. Another church member, noticing
        my enthusiasm, bought a guitar for me for
        Christmas, and another member taught me my
        first chord: E minor. I wrote a song with
        that chord, and my acapella days were over.
        <br>
        <br>
        Twenty two years, three bands, and several
        line-ups later, I'm still writing music.
        I've learned to play guitar, bass, and 
        drums proficiently, as well as how to 
        utilize a handful of different types of 
        recording software to produce my songs. 
        My brother, also an avid musician and 
        percussionist, has joined me in my musical
        endeavors. Throughout my life, my biggest 
        obstacle was myself. My proclivites were 
        often less than healthy, and my personality 
        disorder tended to exacerbate them by 
        robbing me of focus.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, this time 
        is different.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've grown out of unproductive trivialities 
        in my old age. I have 100 songs written in 
        my head, and I have to get them out. Will I 
        make money and tour the country? Probably 
        not. But I WILL be a musician. Promise.
        <br>
